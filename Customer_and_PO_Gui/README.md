Customer_and_PO_Gui
==============

I made this GUI app in Python with the Tkinter library as an aide for my job as bookkeeper for MFC. It has two main views, Sales and POs.
In the sales view, I kept track of all the open customers with various notes. And in the PO view I kept track of all the open Purchase Orders.
Both views could be filtered. And in both I could push items to history once they were completed. All of the data was held in Python pickle files. I also made a button in the GUI to export to a .csv if that was ever needed. The main app window is SalesApp.pyw.
