Vendor_Pricing_and_Sales_Tax_App
==============

This is a small GUI I made in Python with the Tkinter library. I used it as as aide for my bookkeeping position as MFC Workstations. 
I later developed it into a Django app which you can view at: http://mfcoffice.herokuapp.com/home/ .
This app has two functions: You can lookup information about products by sku, and lookup sales tax rate by city.
